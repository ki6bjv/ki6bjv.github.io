Today I am spending most of my day refershing the page on the [MacRumors website](http://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-7-7-t-mobile-pre-order-thread.1992286) and constatly checcking my order status in the T-Mobile app in my phone. 

All because I am one of those terrible people that stayed up late on a thursday night to order an phone that doesnt come out until a week later. 

Yup I am getting an iPhone 7.......Plus.........in........Jet Black. 

And I am crazy for doing so. 

But then I am an Apple fan and they did do [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjgtLSHhTPg) back in the day.
