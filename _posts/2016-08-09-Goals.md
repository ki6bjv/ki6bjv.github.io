title: Goals 
---

***

So life goals I guess that is a thing going around the internet. 

And since I have been kind of trying to figure out what I want to do with my life, aka what the hell is going to make me happy?

***

In no particular order here it goes:

* Blog once a week
* Speak at a SQLSaturday
* Buy a house
* Go back to Europe
* Visit Disney World
* Lose about 100 pounds
* Release my new app
* Finally get my degree
* Go on a cruise
* Get a job working from home
* Put out a podcast 

***
In all honesty I dont think that checking off any of the items on this list will make much difference to my 'happiness', for the most part I am quite happy I just want to feel like I have accomplished more in my life. 

I have done quite a bit, I look at where I was 5 years ago and I cringe about many of the things my life. I have come so far in the last few years. I just feel like if I list it out here and put it out in the world I might be somewhat more accountable.

So the plan? I think a check in every six months and update the list with those items I have accomplished and possibly adding more goals.
