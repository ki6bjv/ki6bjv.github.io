title: Strange Times

As if we all don't know it all ready, we are truly living in stange times. 

I was prepared for zombies, not Captain Tripps.

Then again life is not exactly known for going the way you expect. 

I miss people. 

Which seems odd as I have never considered myself a 'people' person. 

I wish I could get dressed up nice and go out and have a great meal with good friends. 

Of course right now these things are just not possible. 

I guess technically they are possible (insert technically correct joke here), however it is just not a risk I am willing to take right now. 

I hope the fall and winter are not as bad as I worry they will be. 

I hope we can start to get back to dinners and Disneyland and Vegas. 

I just know it is not happening soon, not until next year at the earliest. 

It's going to be a long winter...
