title: Still working it all out	
---

I have not done the best so far with posting here at least once a week. 

I am not going to let that hold me back though, I am not going to give up on this, maybe with time I will start to form some habits. 

For right now I just want to throw out a couple of the things I am working on outside of work. 

I recently went to the annual [CETPA Conferance](http://cetpa.net). While there 'after hours' I got into a discussion with some collegues about something that has been rolling around in my head for a bit. I am being intentional vague here as I am working on a session for next years conference based on this discussion. As I get a bit further into the process I will share more details.

Starting in December I am also going to be taking on a leadership role in my local CETPA group. While this is not strictly non-work related, I still want to throw this out there.

In the mean time I am still working on one of my iOS projects and in planning stages for another. Mostly these are my hobby projects and I don't think I am going to make a tom of headway on them. However they are something I can work on that for me is relaxing. 

I have also been playing around with [Docker](https://www.docker.com) on my Mac and getting MS SQL Server running on [Linux](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/dataplatforminsider/2016/11/16/announcing-sql-server-on-linux-public-preview-first-preview-of-next-release-of-sql-server/) in a Docker container and testing some workloads on it. 

And finally the big one, It's time to for me to go back to school and get that degree. Only way for me to move up and reach some of the goals I have for myself at this point is to get that paper.
