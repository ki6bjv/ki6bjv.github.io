---
 Almost 2 years in fact.

 Life has gotten in the way, I guess you could say. 

 The last year or so has been a bit of a rough patch. 
* Changed jobs(my decsion and a really good one) 
* Moved quickly out the house we had lived in for 3 years and we were was basically homeless/staying with friends for 6 months
* bought a house 3 months ago. 
* Finally starting to feel like I know what I am doing at my *new* job that I have had for almost a year

Now that things are starting to get back to *normal* so to speak, I am going to get back to posting here. 

***

So my plan is to get back into doing the things I like in tech that are pure pleasure for me. Ham Radios, writing code for my own pleasure and projects, speaking/presenting on more diffrent topics. 

I might even try to final get that SQl user group up and running. 

More to come soon...
