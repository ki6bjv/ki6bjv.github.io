title: We have landed!

We managed to make it to Portland. The trip was uneventful, mostly just tiring. 

Traveling with a small dog and a cat that have never done so before was a bit exhausting. Not that thye were/are really a problem, more my own anxieties about them were the issue. 

Now we are going to take the weekend to decompress, we just had our first home cooked meal in about a week, and then start the process of finding an apartment to rent. 

Onwards and upwards, as the say. If you'll pardon the pun.
